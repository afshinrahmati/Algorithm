# Transistors
* that is a kilied that work automaticly when current go there is active automaticly
* can read data from hard ware

# Latency
## tCL
* the time that data to ready for read
## tRCD

## tRP

## tRAS


# CLR 
* automaticlayy garbageCollector.
## JIT (Just-in-time)
* transform our code to machine code.
## TypeSystem
* division byte to the type  ==> long n byte

## Exception handling 
* magaing the crash core
## GC (Garbage Collector).
