# Algorithm
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions,Algorithm is a step-by-step for solving a problem.
Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing.
# DataStructure
is a way of organized and processing and storing retrieving the data.
## two broad categories:
### Linear Data Structure :
Date elements are arranged sequentially or lineart that which element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements Examples are array, stack, queue, etc.
### on-linear Data Structure :
Date elements are not sequentially or lineart like trees and graphs.

# What is Big O :
Big o notation is mathmatical notation that describe the limiting behavior a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
1) o(1) ==> console.log(1).
2) Log O(n) ==>half the date.
3) o(n) ==> for(loop).
4) o(n^2) ==> nest for.
5) o(2^n )==> the recursive Fibonacci algorithm.
<!-- Basic Date Structures -->
# LinkList 
it is a type of the data structure use for storing conection of data. the data store in node each of has Or contain of a dad field with refrecnce (link) to the next node in the sequence;
2 types link0list ==> 1. single link-list 2.doubly link-list
1.single ==> each nodes points to the next node and end is null
2.doubly ==> each node has two link

# Stack
Stack in Data Structures is a liner type abd follows the LIFO <last-in-first-out> that can insert or delete form top of the data.
Implement Stack contiguous memory which is Array, or non-contiguous memory like linklist.
push(),pop(),peek(),isEmpty()
